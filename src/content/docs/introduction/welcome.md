Welcome to this documentation.

## Definition

Performative transactions are specialized artistic interactions that integrate both human creativity and AI contributions within a collaborative framework. In performative transactions, creative processes are embedded into others in contractual agreements managed by smart contracts, ensuring the seamless execution and integration of various artistic contributions. They facilitate transparent and collaborative creation, allowing artists to define the terms under which their work can be utilized by others, promoting a culture of shared innovation and artistic development without the need for centralized oversight.
