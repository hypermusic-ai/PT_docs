## Functions:

1. Create transaction
2. Fire the transaction

## Some rules (to be sorted in order)

Once deployed, Performative Transactions (PTs) exist in versions. Each PTs version is non-editable, but every PT has a function to create its new version. This is because PTs can be dependent on each other. This design choice ensures that once one PT is made dependent on a one version of another PT, this version will always be available.

New versions of PTs can only be created by the original author (public key) of that PT.
