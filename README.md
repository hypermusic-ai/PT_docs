# Performative Transactions - Docs

Deployed at: https://pt-docs.netlify.app/
(Push to branch/main to automatically deploy the update.)

## Edit docs:

To add documentation pages, add Markdown files (`.md` or `.mdx`) in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Commands:

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
